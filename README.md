# 📅 Dynamic JavaScript Calendar Application

This project implements a user-friendly, Google Calendar-like interface using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It features dynamic month navigation, the ability to add new events, and sophisticated conflict detection based on event scheduling times.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Month Navigation:** Easily move between previous and next months.
* **Current Day Highlight:** Visually highlights the current date for context.
* **Dynamic Event Loading:** Events are loaded from a static data source (JS array).
* **Event Creation:** Users can click on any date cell to add new events via a modal form.
* **Time-Based Conflict Detection:** The calendar checks for actual **time overlap** between scheduled events on the same day.
    * **Visual Warning:** Overlapping events are color-coded (Orange border) for immediate user feedback.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and basic layout.
* **CSS3:** Styling, grid layout, and visual cues.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic for rendering, navigation, event handling, and conflict algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository (or save the files):**
    ```bash
    # If using Git
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Project Folder]
    ```
2.  **Open the Files:** Ensure you have the three necessary files in the same directory:
    * `index.html`
    * `style.css`
    * `script.js`
3.  **Launch:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## 🧑‍💻 Development & Collaboration

### 1. Initial Framework (Gemini Coding Partner)

This project began with a significant amount of the foundational code generated by **Gemini** (as a helpful AI coding partner). The initial request focused on creating the basic calendar structure, implementing month navigation, and handling static event display using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

* **Initial Contribution:** Provided the complete base HTML structure, the grid-based CSS layout, and the core JavaScript functions for `renderCalendar()` and basic event iteration.

### 2. Technical Refinements and Enhancements

Following the initial framework, the application was enhanced and finalized using my technical knowledge and direct implementation of required business logic.

Key changes and custom logic I developed include:

| Feature | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Event Creation** | Added the **HTML Modal** and the full **JavaScript event listeners** for date cell clicks, form handling, and dynamically updating the `staticEvents` array. |
| **Advanced Conflict Logic** | Implemented the **`getTimeBoundary`** and the revised **`hasConflict`** functions. This involved using string manipulation (`.split()`, `.match()`) and mathematical calculations to convert `HH:MM` time and `duration` (e.g., '1h30m') into total **minutes from midnight**, enabling true time-based overlap detection. |
| **Styling Hierarchy** | Refined the CSS to support multi-level visual feedback, specifically implementing the dedicated styling for events that have a confirmed time overlap (`.conflict-level-2`). |
